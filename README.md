# Analyzing-Urbanization-of-Countries

The aim of this project is to analyze and plot the Urbanization of countries.

There are two measures of the degree of urbanization of a population. The first, urban population, describes the percentage of the total population living in urban areas, as defined by the country.

The second measure, rate of urbanization, describes the projected average rate of change of the size of the urban population over the given period of time.

## The Urbanization Rates of different countries

Rate of urbanization, describes the projected average rate of change of the size of the urban population over the given period of time.In this data set the time duration is from 2010 - 2015.

## Conclusion

The above plots show us that some of the __Gulf__ countries are having most Percentage of Urban Population and Highest Urbanization Rates too. Also some of the poor __African__ countries have seen a growth in Urbanization rates over the past years.
